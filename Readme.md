# Doomscroll Control

This browser extension aims to get you out of the state of **mindlessly scrolling** on those websites that are designed to get you to **scroll like a mindless zombie**.

When entering such a website, you will see a window, that will remind you to only stay on the website as long as you enjoy your stay.
You will estimate how long you would actually like to stay on this website and then proceed with your visit on the website as usual.
After the time is up, the reminding window will show again. This is the moment where you should ask yourself if you really still enjoy your time, or if you have already turned into a scrolling zombie. 

Click the toolbar-icon to it to add/remove doomscroll websites or access.
